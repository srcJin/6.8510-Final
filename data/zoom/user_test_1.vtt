1
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.880
Right.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.079
Jin Gao: Hey, Shannon, have you seen the new Evs? They are not only good for the environment, but also loaded, loaded with the latest tech.

3
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:22.829
ChenAn Shen: I've seen them, Jean. They look great. But on there still, big issues like charging stations, are hard to find. And aren't they still more expensive?

4
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.110
Jin Gao: Well, yeah, it is true that charging infrastructure needs catching up.

5
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:40.069
Jin Gao: but it's growing quickly. Many cities are adding stations every day. As for cost prices have been falling, and don't forget the savings on gas and maintenance.

6
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.739
ChenAn Shen: But what about long trips? Though if I plan to drive cross country, am I not going to face issues with charging times and availability.

7
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.860
Jin Gao: Well, that's a fair point. However.

8
00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:02.849
Jin Gao: newer models are pushing 300 miles per charge, plus fast chargers can give you to 80% in under an hour

9
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.970
Jin Gao: is becoming more practical.

10
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:16.399
ChenAn Shen: Well, I guess, for city driving babies make a lot of sense. But there's still the environmental cost of batteries. Mining for lithium cobalt. Isn't that troubling.

11
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.670
Jin Gao: Well, definitely a concern. Hmm, and not something to overlook.

12
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.350
Jin Gao: But the industry is moving towards more sustainable practices and materials.

13
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.590
Jin Gao: plus overall ebs. Still have a smaller carbon footprint compared to few cars.

14
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.700
ChenAn Shen: How do you handle battery disposal? Isn't that an environmental hazard, too.

15
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.200
Jin Gao: Many companies are working on recycling programs to handle end of life end of life batteries.

16
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:55.130
Jin Gao: The technology for battery disposal is improving, improving, aiming and reclaiming and use

17
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.320
Jin Gao: will reuse materials.

18
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:05.590
ChenAn Shen: It seems like there's progress, but maybe it's too soon to switch completely. Perhaps hybrids are a good middle ground, for now.

19
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.509
Jin Gao: Hybrids could be a great step for many.

20
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.520
Jin Gao: They combine the best of the both words, and it's all about having choices that feed different needs.

21
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.789
Jin Gao: The important thing is we if we keep moving toward more sustainable options.

22
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.590
ChenAn Shen: Who

23
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.950
ChenAn Shen: I think I need to look into this more, maybe test, drive, and ev sometime, and see how it feels.

24
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.670
Jin Gao: Yeah, that sounds like a plan. Let's keep this conversation going and check out some options together.

25
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.950
Jin Gao: It is an exciting time for car technology.
