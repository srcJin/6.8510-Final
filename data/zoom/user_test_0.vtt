00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.719
Selena Zhang: Listen, Mark, doubling the price of your bestsellers, just prices us small bookstores out of the competition.

2
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.110
Selena Zhang: How's that fair.

3
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.909
Jin Gao: Well, it's not about fairness, Jessica.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.460
Jin Gao: It's business.

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.809
Jin Gao: The cost are going up, and we have to adjust.

6
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.380
Selena Zhang: Adjust. This isn't adjusting. It's arm twisting. You're basically telling us to pay up or shut down.

7
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.409
Jin Gao: Well, I understand it is tough. But let's find a way to work together.

8
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.959
Jin Gao: What if we offer a tiered discount system based on volume.

9
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.180
Selena Zhang: Volume. You know we can't order as much as the big chains that offer does nothing for us.

10
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.263
Jin Gao: Okay, okay.

11
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.329
Jin Gao: let's think about this. So how about we set up an exclusive local author section in your store?

12
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.849
Jin Gao: We supply the books and you provide the space, and we split, split the revenue.

13
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.180
Selena Zhang: that's

14
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:18.029
Selena Zhang: well, that's actually not a bad idea. But the split needs to be favorable to us. We can't lose out in our own store.

15
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.179
Jin Gao: True. So what if we go 60, 40, your way

16
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:33.620
Jin Gao: on local authors? And I can push for a 5% additional discount on the bestsellers.

17
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.870
Jin Gao: If your host monthly events.

18
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.690
Selena Zhang: Okay, make it 10%. And you've got yourself more than just events. We can do promotions, signings, the works.

19
00:01:49.260 --> 00:02:00.159
Jin Gao: Okay, okay, okay, ha, ha, ha! 10%. It is. You drive a hard bargain. And Jessica, I'll have to tell my team that you are quite the negotiator.

20
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.499
Selena Zhang: Well, I'll tell mine that someone in the big, bad world of corporate publishing has their back after all.

21
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.949
Jin Gao: So do we have a deal, then.

22
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.010
Selena Zhang: Yeah, Mark, we have a deal. And hopefully.

23
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.430
Selena Zhang: we'll have a start to a better partnership, too.
