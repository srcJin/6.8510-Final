00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.290
User 2: Oh, I'm really stressed about my group project. It feels like I'm only one putting in any efforts.

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.803
User 2: Will this affect my grade? I can't afford to mess this up.

3
00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:21.359
User 1: I understand this feeling. It's tough when the group dynamics are but balanced.

4
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:31.079
User 1: Have you tried setting up a meeting to discuss everyone's responsibility. Clearly, sometimes communication can really help align the efforts.

5
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:41.060
User 2: Who had meetings. But it's always the same, they said. They'll contribute more, but nothing changes so frustrating and unfair.

6
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:55.039
User 1: Oh, that does sounds frustrating. Maybe it's time to approach this differently. How about dividing the test based on each member's strands? It can motivate them, to participate more actively.

7
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.489
User 2: I guess I haven't really considered these their strengths. I've been too caught up

8
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.070
User 2: just getting things done. But what if it doesn't work either?

9
00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:26.639
User 1: It's worse or tries. And it might just change the dynamic plus if you document this offers, you can discuss with them with your professor. And if the problem persists, and Professor can be very understanding about this situations.

10
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:39.130
User 2: That's a good point. Maybe if I show I've made every effort to manage this positively, it could reflect well on me. I haven't thought about taking the Professor like that.

11
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:54.200
User 1: Yeah, exactly. Showing initiative can only reflect positively on you. And also consider this as a learning opportunity in leadership and problem solving developable skills in any career.

12
00:01:55.059 --> 00:02:00.330
User 2: You're right. Maybe this is a chance to develop my leadership skills.

13
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.990
User 2: I would try to view this as a challenge rather than a setback.

14
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:21.250
User 1: Yeah, that's the spirit. Take it as a challenge, and whatever the outcome, you will have gained something valuable. And remember, I'm here to help brainstorm or practice, and the difficult conversation you might need to have with your group.

15
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.876
User 2: Oh, thank you for the advice and support. I feel better about handling this now.

16
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.889
User 2: I will start by proposing a new plan based on everyone's friends, and see how it goes.

17
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:45.349
User 1: You're welcome. With a proactive approach, you're sure to see more positive changes can be updated, and don't hesitate to reach out. If you need any more help.
