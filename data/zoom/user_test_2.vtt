00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.780
User 1: Grew up.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.840
User 2: I should hold a month.

3
00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:07.550
User 1: Angela. Okay.

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.420
User 1: I can't believe they approved this massive development without any proper dialogue with us it's completely unfair.

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.740
User 1: Our neighborhood is going to suffer from endless construction. Noise, increased traffic. And we're losing our parks, too.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.470
User 2: I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we didn't make this decision lightly.

7
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:39.179
User 2: The project went through numerous studies and public consultations. It's aimed at addressing the city's housing shortage and revitalizing the the area.

8
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.490
User 1: It feels like our little community is being sacrificed for so-called progress.

9
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.720
User 1: Our kids play in that park.

10
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.419
User 1: It's not just about buildings, it's about quality of life.

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.120
User 1: How can we call this progress when it costs us our open spaces?

12
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.600
User 2: I absolutely see your point.

13
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.369
User 2: And it's important for us to find a balance. Let's discuss how we can incorporate

14
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.359
User 2: green spaces into the new development. Maybe there's room for a smart smaller park

15
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.520
User 2: or rooftop gardens.

16
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.830
User 1: I appreciate that suggestion.

17
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:29.190
User 1: but it still feels like a consolation price. How we ensure those plans don't just remain on paper. We need concrete commitments.

18
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.899
User 2: We can work on setting up a community oversight committee that includes residents like yourself.

19
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.100
User 2: This committee can have a say in the development stages and monitor the inclusion of grace, spaces.

20
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.480
User 1: That sounds like a step in the right direction. If there is gin oversights and real inputs from us, perhaps we can find a way to make this work for everyone.

21
00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:04.330
User 2: I'm glad to hear you think so. It's crucial for us to work together. On this I arranged for the first meeting of the oversight committee and ensure all voices are heard.

22
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.519
User 2: Let's aim for a development that sanifes the city. While respecting this current, the residence.

23
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.889
User 1: I look forward to seeing how this develops. Thank you for being open to our feedback. It's refreshing to see our concerns being taken seriously.

24
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:31.759
User 2: Thank you for your willingness to engage. It's only through collaboration that we can ensure. The project truly enhances the community. Let's keep this dialogue open and constructive.

25
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.700
User 1: Okay.
