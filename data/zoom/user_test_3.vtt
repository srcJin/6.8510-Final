00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.240
User 2: I'm generally worried about this overhaul.

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.299
User 2: It seems like we're being punished into one. Size fits. All approach

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.039
User 2: fair is that it will strip away our ability

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.050
User 2: to treat each patient as an individual individual.

5
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.130
User 2: reducing the quality of care we can provide.

6
00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:29.030
User 1: We're definitely not aiming to do personalized healthcare. The idea behind this overhaul is to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy, bringing to focus more on patient care rather than paper.

7
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.860
User 2: Hard not to feel skeptical

8
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.540
User 2: every time there's a new system, it just adds another layer of complexity.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.049
User 2: We end up spending more time on training and compliance, instead of actually helping patients.

10
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:57.329
User 1: You can see how past experiences might make you feel that way. Let me assure you the training for this new system is designed to be intuitive and supportive. We're investing in state of the art technology that's user friendly and actually decreases your administrative mode.

11
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.280
User 2: Oh, I want to believe that's true. It's technology can really reduce that administrative burden and not just add it. That will be significant improvement.

12
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:19.190
User 1: Exactly. That's the goal. Moreover, we're setting up a feedback loop with frontline workers like yourself. This way we can quickly identify issues with the system, and make adjustments where necessary.

13
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.200
User 2: Hmm! That sounds promising.

14
00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:34.639

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:44.559
User 1: Your input is crucial. After all, you and your colleagues are the ones who we use the system daily. We need your expertise to ensure. It works well in practical, real world scenarios

16
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.860
User 1: 6, 1, 6.

17
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:58.289
User 2: I appreciate this, a pro collaborative approach. It gave me hope. And this transition might actually improve our work environment and the care we provide, and looking forward to seeing how it goes.

18
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:08.209
User 1: Thank you for being open to these changes. I'm confident that together we can create a system that not only meets but exceeds our healthcare expectations. Let's make this a model for others to follow.
